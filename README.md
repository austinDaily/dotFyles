# Dotfyles - A CLI Dotfile Manager
Dotfyles is a command-line tool that scans your Home directory for your important dotfiles, creates a dedicated directory for them, and pushes this repository to your GitHub account, **all with one command**. This makes it easy to back up, restore, and share your configuration files across different systems.

## Features
- **Automatic Collection of Dotfiles**: Gathers common configuration files from your home directory.
- **GitHub Integration**: Uses GitHub’s Device Flow for authentication and pushes the collected dotfiles to your GitHub repository.
- **Symbolic Linking**: Creates symbolic links to the original files, ensuring that your configurations stay in sync.
- **Customizable**: Extend the list of dotfiles as needed to meet your setup requirements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (latest version recommended)
- Git
- A GitHub account.
- Make sure your GitHub account does not already contain a repo called "dotfyles", as this program will overwrite it.

### Usage
```bash
dotfyles init
```
This command will create a git repo in your Home directory called "myDotfyles", scan your Home directory for important configuration files/dirs, copy/symlink them to the "myDotfyles" repo, stage and commit them to Git, and finally push them to your GitHub. When you run this command, you will be given an authorization code to enter into GitHub. Once you enter the correct auth code, your "myDotfyles" repo will be push to your GitHub.
